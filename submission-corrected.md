## How I Used Google AI Studio

I leveraged Google AI Studio extensively to power the multimodal capabilities:

### 1. Gemini 2.5 Flash for Skin Analysis (Image + Video)

- Integrated Gemini's vision capabilities to analyze uploaded skin photos and videos
- Provides detailed assessments of skin conditions, moles, rashes, and other dermatological concerns
- Supports video analysis for dynamic skin condition monitoring and movement patterns
- Returns structured health insights with confidence scores and recommendations
- Supports multiple video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM) up to 25MB

### 2. Gemini 2.5 Flash for Health Chat

- Powers the conversational AI health assistant
- Processes natural language health questions and provides evidence-based responses
- Maintains conversation context for follow-up questions

### 3. Imagen 4.0 for Health Infographics

- Integrated Google Imagen 4.0 for professional medical infographic generation
- Creates medication schedules, health progress charts, and symptom tracking visuals
- Generates accessible, high-contrast infographics with professional medical styling
- Supports download and sharing of AI-generated health content
- Uses latest Imagen for cutting-edge image generation

### 4. Multimodal Integration

- Combined text, image, video, voice, and AI-generated visual content for comprehensive health monitoring

## Multimodal Features

### üé• Video + Text Analysis (Skin Analysis Page)

- Video Skin Monitoring: Users upload videos for dynamic skin condition analysis and movement patterns
- Symptom Documentation: Video recordings of skin symptoms for detailed medical assessment

### üñºÔ∏è Image + Text Analysis

- Skin Photo Analysis: Users upload photos of skin conditions, and Gemini analyzes them for potential health concerns
- Medication OCR: Scans medication labels and bottles to extract drug information, dosages, and instructions

### üé§ Voice + Text Processing

- Voice Symptom Logger: Records audio descriptions of symptoms and converts them to structured text
- Voice Navigation: Complete app navigation using voice commands ("go home", "skin analysis", "emergency")
- Audio Feedback: Text-to-speech responses for accessibility

### üí¨ Conversational AI

- Contextual Health Chat: AI remembers previous conversations and provides personalized health guidance
- Seamless Analysis Integration: After any analysis (skin, medication, voice logger), users can click "Discuss with AI Assistant" to continue the conversation with full context of their analysis results

### ‚ôø Accessibility-First Design

- Screen Reader Compatible: Full ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- Voice Commands: Navigate the entire app using voice ("skin analysis", "medication scanner", "help")
- High Contrast Mode: Enhanced visibility for users with visual impairments
- Font Scaling: Adjustable text size up to 300%
- Keyboard Navigation: Complete app functionality without mouse

### üé® AI-Generated Visual Content

- Health Infographics: Professional medical charts and schedules generated by Imagen 4.0
- Medication Schedules: Visual medication timing and dosage charts
- Progress Tracking: Health milestone and achievement visualizations
- Symptom Charts: Color-coded symptom monitoring and tracking graphics
- Download & Share: Export AI-generated infographics for medical consultations

### üîÑ Data Integration

- Health Records: All multimodal inputs (videos, images, voice, chat, infographics) are stored and organized
- Export Capabilities: Users can export their health data and AI-generated infographics for medical consultations
- Video Storage: Secure video analysis results

## Technical Implementation

- Frontend: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- AI Integration: Google AI Studio with Gemini 2.5 Flash (video, image, text, audio) and Imagen 4.0 (infographics)
- Voice Processing: Web Speech API for speech-to-text and text-to-speech
- Image Processing: Canvas API for image optimization and preprocessing
- Deployment: Google Cloud Run with automatic scaling
- Database: Supabase for health records and user data
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with comprehensive testing

## Impact & Accessibility

This project demonstrates how AI can make healthcare more accessible to everyone, particularly:

- Visually impaired users who can navigate entirely by voice
- Elderly users who may have difficulty with complex interfaces
- Users with motor disabilities who rely on voice commands
- Non-native speakers who can describe symptoms in their own words

The multimodal approach ensures that health monitoring is not limited by traditional input methods, making medical assistance truly inclusive.
